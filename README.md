# Advanced-Neural-Networks- Projects
## Collection of advanced neural networks projects  

Welcome to the repository of my Advanced Neural Networks (ANN) projects! This collection includes several ANN-based machine learning models and algorithms, designed and implemented for various tasks. Each project includes a detailed PDF explanation of the underlying methods, algorithms, and key concepts.

## Projects Overview

Each project demonstrates a unique ANN technique and tackles a specific problem or dataset.

## Included Files

1. **Code**: The main implementation of each project, typically written in Python mainly using Google Colab.
2. **Datasets**: The datasets used in each project will also be uploaded. 
3. **PDF Explanation**: A detailed PDF file for each project, explaining the theoretical background, and algorithm of each experiment.

## Why Neural Networks?

Neural networks are a powerful class of machine learning algorithms inspired by the human brain. They excel at solving complex problems that are challenging for traditional algorithms, such as:
- Image recognition
- Time series forecasting
- Natural language processing
- Anomaly detection

The key advantage of ANN models lies in their ability to learn hierarchical features from raw data, making them versatile and widely used in fields like computer vision, speech recognition, and medical diagnostics.

## How to Use the Code

### Prerequisites

To run these projects, you'll need the following software:
- Python 3.x
- TensorFlow/Keras, PyTorch (depending on the project)
- NumPy, Pandas, Matplotlib (for data manipulation and visualization)
- you can also use google Colab to run the code and see the results.
